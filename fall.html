  <p>"No! how did you get to the conclusion of this? I was with you all the time! I cooked the pie with you! When the pie was finished we put it on the table for the pie to rest! And we went to look at the flowers together before we came back to find that our pie was eaten! Why do I even have to explain to you? We were literally together!"

    <p>Fall was hanged by the rooftop of her tree house, she struggles to flee, but no matter how hard she tries, the rope that was hanging her became even stronger. Rain was holding a knife, ready to let gravity do its thing.
      <br>
      <p>"Rain! listen to me RAINNNN!!!!"
        <br>
        <p>Fall falls onto the greenish ground below, now was painted bright red with the fluid from her head, decorating the green grass with red matter of hers, she once more created an artpiece from nature.

          <p>Goodbye, my good friend...
