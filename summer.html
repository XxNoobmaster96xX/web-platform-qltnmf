 <body style="background-color:orange;">
  <p>"No! It wasn't me! I didn't eat your pie!"
  <br>
  <p>Summer cried out with despair as rain took her up to the cross, summer's tears were as shiny as sunlight, like a bringer of hope, oh, the irony of life.
  <br>
  <p>"Please believe me! I would never eat your pie without asking for your permission! Please spare me...Please...."
  <br>
  <p>Rain took her up the cross and tied her with a series of red ropes, resembling her bright red eyes, the teary eyes before her, crying until the tears are drained, crying until blood came out. Crying until there was no voice to come out of her throat anymore...
    <br>
    <p>Poor you, my beloved friend...</p>
