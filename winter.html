<h1>You choosed winter to be eliminated</h1>

 <body style="background-color:skyblue;">
  <p>"I said what I said, I always tell the truth, and I wasn't going to eat anything that day, I would never do such a thing without asking you for permission."
    <br>
    <p>Winter was heavily chained to the valcano's opening, she said her last vows without tears, was she always this cold-hearted?
      <br>
      <p>"Please...Don't do this to me..."
        <br>
        <p>Winter's body starts to melt, the red color contrasting with her ice cold eyes are magnificant and majestic, what a view to lay your eyes upon. Almost like this is the one moment in one hundred years.
          <br>
          <p>Farewell, my dear friend...</p>
