    <p>Artsy girl UwU, my hobbies are singing, writing novels, drawing, sleeping on my bed and imagined a world where I exist as a fairy of animals.
    <br>
    <p>My favorite food is grilled fish! I love eating fish, like, if I could eat fish <i>all day</i> I would. And my favorite drink is absolutely tea baby, gimme all the hot steamy tea, and my other favorite drink is lemonade soda, I swear that thing slaps harder than my mom's belt.
    <br>
    <p>I love reading novels, like <strong>Lovecraft's, Doyle's</strong>, and other cool authors who got the wildest imagination like holy cow after I read I can't just move on from it I need to sleep with my lights on or else some freaky ass creature will follow me into my dreams, or nightmare.
    <br>
   <p>Here are the list of novels I read if you cared to give a sheeeeeet</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A pocket full of rye-by Agatha Chistie</li>
      <li>The call of Chthulu-by H.P.Lovecraft</li>
      <li>Every Sherlock Holmes series by Conan Doyle</li>
      <li>The intrepretation of a dream-by Sigmund Froyde</li>
    </ul>
   <p>And OMG I forgot to mention about my most extremely favorite thing to do, Music! Oh I love music to my death, no music no life is my life's motto. I listen to every kind of music and I don't discriminate, cause music is art, and art has no bounds, except for those cringey ass low market musics ugh please make it stop. 
    Also here's the list of music I'd like you to give it a listen!
