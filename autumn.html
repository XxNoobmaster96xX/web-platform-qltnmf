  <p>"No! I definately did not eat your pie! Why don't anyone believe me?"
    <br>
    <p>Autumn screeches as she was dragged to the tall flower pole, her eyes are as colorful as a bouquet of thousands of florals, her tears reflecting the color like a mirror gateway to the world of flowers.
      <br>
      <p>"I apologize! I am sorry, but I never, ever touched your pie! Please don't hurt me!"
        <br>
        <p>Rain used a knife to cut down autumn's stomache, revealing red liquids and red matter inside, but more importantly, she found the pie inside her stomache!
          <br>
          <p>The curiosity got into you, my sweet friend...
            <br>
            <p>Rain said to her dead friend, impaled on the pole. While looking lovingly at her, rain feed herself some red, sweet, pie.
