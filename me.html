 <h2 style="color:red;">Look what curiosity brought you, kitty</h2>
  <p style="color:red;">Well hello there, let's not waste anymore time, cause it's time for puzzles :) </p>
  <br>
  <p style="color:white;">The goddess of five seasons are invited to the tea party, summer was playing chess with water fairy while sipping tea, autumn was singing with the wood fairies by the wooden cabin, winter was reading under the big oak tree near where summer was sitting with the water fairy, and rain was cooking pie with fall, after sometime, rain and the fall left the pie on the table near the cabin where autumn was, for after sometime, when rain and fall got back, the pie disapeared!
  <br>
<p style="color:white;">Then, rain brought everyone to the table by the cabin, and interrogated the seasons Goddess one by one
<br>
<p style="color:white;">First, rain asked summer where she was and what was she doing, autumn said,</p>

  <p style="color:orange;">"I playing chess with the water fairy, and fair enough, I smelled the pie, but the one who ate your pie was autumn, she stopped singing for a while so I went to take a look, and she was chomping down on the pie!. Me and winter saw her!." </p>
  <p style="color:white;">Then, rain asked winter where she was and what was she doing, winter said,</p>
  <p style="color:skyblue;">"I was reading under the oak tree, and summer was eyeing on the pie, but I didn't notice what she did, maybe she might be the one who ate your pie. And I heard autumn sang the whole time so I don't suspect her."</p>
  <p style="color:white;">Then, rain asked autumn where she was and what was she doing, autumn said,</p>
  <p style="color:pink;">"I was singing with my fairy friends, I didn't even notice you were putting the pie on the table, but I did see winter walking over to the table lookin at the pie, I suspect her to be your pie eater! I and summer saw her walking over there!"</p>
  <p style="color:White;">Everyone was accusing one another, summer accused autumn of eating rain's pie, autumn accused winter of eating rain's pie, and winter accused summer of eating rain's pie!</p>
  <p style="color:White;">Rain took sometime to think over and over again, but she can never find who ate her pie! Now, it's up to you to decide who will be eliminated for eating rain's pie!</p>
